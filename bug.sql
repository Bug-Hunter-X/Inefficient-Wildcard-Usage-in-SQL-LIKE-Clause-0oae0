The SQL query uses a wildcard character (%) in the beginning of a LIKE clause, which can lead to performance issues or unexpected results. For example, the query `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE '%John%'` would scan the entire table to find rows that contain 'John' anywhere in the name field, while `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'John%'` would be much more efficient as it checks for names starting with 'John'.
